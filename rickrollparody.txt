Me: Make a parody of the Rickroll song about Rickrolling.

ChatGPT: Sure!

Sure, here's a parody of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" all about the infamous internet prank known as Rickrolling:

Verse 1:
We're no strangers to the net
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what we get
When we're searching for a laugh online

Pre-chorus:
You wouldn't think it's so bizarre
To click a link that seems legit
But suddenly you're face to face
With Rick Astley's famous hit

Chorus:
We're Rickrolling, never gonna stop
We'll prank you 'til you drop
You might as well just grin and bear
The fact that Rick's still everywhere

Verse 2:
Your friends might send you a link
To a site they swear is cool
But when you click it, what do you think?
It's just Rick Astley, being a fool

Pre-chorus:
We know it's kind of mean
To trick you with this old tune
But really, can you blame us
For wanting to Rickroll you?

Chorus:
We're Rickrolling, never gonna stop
We'll prank you 'til you drop
You might as well just grin and bear
The fact that Rick's still everywhere

Bridge:
We'll never give you up
Never gonna let you down
We'll Rickroll you all over town

Chorus:
We're Rickrolling, never gonna stop
We'll prank you 'til you drop
You might as well just grin and bear
The fact that Rick's still everywhere

Outro:
We're sorry if we got you good
But really, it's all in fun
Just take a breath and shake it off
And let the Rickrolling be done.
